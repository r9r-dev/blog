Everyone, or almost everyone, knows Whatsapp. In just a few years, Facebook messaging has become the must-have. And it must be said that everyone was happy with it.

## Perfect messaging app, perfect timing

Whatsapp was born from an idea of a young Ukrainian developer: to prevent the Soviet authorities from being able to read his parents' SMS exchanges, he invented an application almost similar to SMS but encrypted. Similar to SMS because his idea was to simply use the phone number to communicate with his friends, in the same way as an SMS.

In addition to easy access, Whatsapp has, since its creation in 2009, laid the foundations for an attractive messaging system:

- No user profile. Just a cell phone number.
- No message storage on servers. Messages only stay on the phones
- End-to-end encryption[^1]

In addition to the proposal, it must be said that at this time the world of private messaging is in a lethargic state. The old messengers like AIM, ICQ and MSN Messenger have not been able to renew themselves through the mobile and people have scattered on different platforms like Facebook Messenger, Google Talk, Viber or WeChat.
So the highway was all mapped out for Whatsapp which, in barely 4 years, was able to claim to have 400 million active users, making this messaging platform, the world's first, and by far (I don't voluntarily count the Chinese mastodon QQ which has never been exported from the country).

So everything was perfect for everyone. Developers continued to add features to an almost free[^2] and ad-free messaging system, and on the other hand, users were thrilled with its efficiency and simplicity.

## The Facebook takeover

On February 19, 2014 (according to Wikipedia), Mister Mark buys Whatsapp for, hang on, $16 billion. Yes, yes. $16 BILLION.

If that number makes you dizzy, I think it can already make you understand the importance of having your hands on private messaging between all the humans on the planet. Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of one of the fastest-growing companies ever, is buying an application that has absolutely no short-term financial prospects. Yes, you've read correctly, Whatsapp brings in â‚¬0.0 since, in addition to the purchase of the Whatsapp Inc. company, Facebook decides that from now on, the application will be totally free. And it still is today.

Despite everything, the app has continued its meteoric rise, reaching more than 2 billion active users in 2020.

## Facebook's business model

Facebook earns a lot of money, it's no mystery. Its revenues are mainly due to the highly targeted advertising campaigns that the platform allows. Today, it is the most efficient platform in the world in this field. As the majority of users share almost all their life on the platform, it is very easy for Facebook to promise results during an advertising campaign. And this proves to be true in practice. On Facebook, anyone can promote a group or a brand with just a few clicks and a good bank account. You can target people with a whole bunch of filters such as time of login, interests, age, location, etc. You can then determine your budget and ... the desired platforms.
Today, the platforms you can use for promotion are :

-	Facebook
-	Instagram
-	Facebook Messenger

Do you see coming the shitty slice of toast, with vomit sauce?

## Whatsapp and MONEY !

Facebook promises its shareholders every year that Whatsapp will bring in a lot of money. Except that for now, well, it's not at all the case. So there are a few initiatives that I guess you'll like a lot.

Today, Facebook knows your personal information. It knows your relationships and your family. It knows what you like and what you don't like. It knows what you do everyday, the type of activity you do, etc. It knows what you do with your family and friends.

But it goes beyond that. It knows your state of mind. When you are doing well or not so well. Advanced algorithms allow Facebook to have a whole bunch of emotional indicators about you. It knows what you need or don't need. And with the marketplace, it knows your spending habits, how you dress, etc. It knows what you're wearing.

But that's not all. Facebook knows where you go and when you go there. We've all had the experience of a friend proposal from someone we met in the evening and with whom we exchanged absolutely nothing. And disabling GPS is not a way to prevent this[^3].

So Facebook has totally different plans for Whatsapp than you can imagine. Their goal is not to facilitate exchanges but to make money. If Whatsapp evolves tomorrow, it won't be for your benefit but for theirs.

Moreover, Whatsapp's latest (or next) innovations show the way:

### Whatsapp Business

Whatsapp Business allows a company to become a contact on the application. A so-called "verified" company that can thus create the link with Instagram or Facebook. It will soon be able to contact its user base directly and later offer to sell its services.

### p2p payment

In India, Whatsapp allows people to send money to each other. Thus, users get used to using Whatsapp when it comes to money. Sharing an expense account, lending each other money, selling a second-hand product, etc.

## DIEM: The Eldorado

In short, everything is starting to take shape in your head, I'm sure. And hopefully, you're beginning to understand why all of this is a problem. The Facebook ecosystem is becoming so powerful that it even seems that we're moving towards a "Facebook Internet". Because indeed, apart from the search engine, what is it missing? Hahaha, you naive people.

Facebook has been working for a few months (a year and a half to be exact), on a "cryptocurrency" called the *Diem*. That is to say, a kind of Bitcoin specific to the platform (even if Facebook is not the only actor of the currency, it is the company that has the initiative). The goal of this "currency" will be to allow exchange between all individuals on earth. In a way, the Diem is a neutral currency of any country that will allow you to convert your dollars to buy goods through platforms such as Whatsapp, Instagram or Facebook (but also others like Paypal, well probably, nothing is sure on this side).

So there it is. As money is not enough, Facebook should have the currency itself. And even though we're still far from dominating national currencies like euro or dollar (the Diem will be directly indexed on these currencies), it still smells like a bad fart.

Imagine a world where you are paid in euros and then you have to convert those euros into a Diem, or rather a ZukerbergCoin to buy your bread at the bakery? Does that sound crazy to you? We already pay with our phone. Honestly, it will be very easy for Facebook (there will only be the adoption rate as a brake).

## Conclusion

So. Don't be one of the actors of the domination of Facebook. Keep your Facebook account only for what it was originally designed to be: a contact directory and a sharing platform. Don't put in what no one cares about: what you like, your age, your home address, etc. People don't read it anyway. In the end, Facebook is the only one who cares.

And don't put all your eggs in one basket and delete Whatsapp right away while there's still time, because in reality, it may already be too late for people to realize the future of this smelly ecosystem. And don't worry, if your friends want to talk to you, there are plenty of other ways, such as SMS.

And by the way, among these other means, there is **exactly the same application as Whatsapp**, but with ambitions that are fundamentally user-oriented and not for profit. And this application is Signal, which will be the subject of the next article on the subject.

[^1]: End-to-end encryption means that the information is encrypted on the sender's terminal and decrypted on the receiver's terminal. That is, no one in the middle is able to read what is being transmitted.

[^2]: This is even more impressive because if Whatsapp today is totally free, it wasn't at that time: in some countries, including the United States, you had to pay a subscription fee of 1 dollar a year to access it.

[^3]: Without going into too much detail, because I don't work at Facebook, but also because we're not here to talk about the technical part, you only need to have access to your bluetooth to locate you more or less precisely. An example: if you come across a person who has his GPS authorized on the Facebook application (because he didn't pay attention) then it's because you weren't very far from him at that moment. With a good algorithm, we can therefore very easily know your comings and goings without GPS. In the same order, if your phone identifies a WIFI network, without connecting to it, it means that you are not very far from it. If another user with his GPS activated connects to it, your position is then known. And don't think that all this is conspiracy. It's just code.
