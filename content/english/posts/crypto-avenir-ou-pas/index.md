TL;DR: Oui.

## Introduction

I first became interested in crypto currencies in the 2010s. At the time, there was probably only Bitcoin. In any case, it was the only crypto currency I knew about. I already found it very fascinating, but mostly I couldn't figure out what it was exactly. A kind of digital money? How does it work? And where is this money really? And is it really money? Can I convert Bitcoin into euros? And if so, how?

10 years have passed. For 10 years, I've seen all this from afar without really being interested in it. Just like Mr. Everyman, I first thought of something that doesn't really exist, that consumes electricity and that, in short, serves no other purpose. Then, a few months ago, I started to get more interested in it. So I started looking for concrete answers to these questions. I started by reading articles on the subject. I read articles about Bitcoin, about other cryptocurrencies, about blockchains, about wallets, about exchanges, about ICOs, about masternodes, about forks, etc. I spent more than a few hours reading them. I used to spend more than an hour a day in the beginning.

I bought crypto currencies first on centralized platforms like a classic bank would. I then used protocols directly on which I traded in euros to cryptocurrency. I bought and sold NFTs. I used decentralized exchangers, I made loans, I even used futures contracts that I didn't even know about in traditional finance. I've done what are called bridges, which are transfer operations from one blockchain to another. I've made a few attempts to develop directly on the blockchain, to better understand smarts contracts.

As I write this, my main Wallet contains 2673 transactions, made in less than a year. On my bank account and over the same period, I would say that I must have between 200 and 300 transactions. So I have done more transactions in one year on blockchains than I have done in 10 years in traditional finance.

So, today, I think I can concretely say if the crypto-currency is useful or not. If it's completely bullshit, if it just consumes electricity. And if, in short, traditional finance has absolutely nothing to fear.

## Cryptocurrency

I don't like to talk about cryptocurrency. To me, it's just money. I guess some people would freak out reading this. Most likely because for a currency to qualify as a currency, it has to be recognized by a country or central bank. Only for the small consumer that I am, I see no difference. I would even say that on the blockchain, everything is so much simpler. On blockchain I don't have a bank. The concept of a bank simply does not exist. There are only account-to-account, wallet-to-wallet exchanges. Moreover, everything happens almost instantaneously. So, admittedly, today, there are quite few links between cryptocurrency and the real world, So much so that I can't go buy a loaf of bread with cryptocurrency. But anything I can buy on the blockchain in today's purely technological world, I can do using my wallet and not a bank.

If you don't know anything about it, imagine a world where banks don't exist.Imagine that in your wallet, you have all your money. All of it. It's as if when you open your wallet, you see all the money you have, but also all the loans you owe, the things you owe someone else. So instead of having a bank, a place where you go to get your money, it's a physical object that has everything in it. And that makes it a lot easier. And that's what makes all the difference and makes things so much simpler. In a totally blockchain world, there's no more Paypal, there's no more Lydia, there's no more restaurant vouchers. There are probably even no more bank cards. There are only people exchanging goods, without intermediaries.

## DeFi

But it doesn't stop there. If there were only exchanges between individuals, the world of finance would not be able to adapt to it. The blockchain can be programmed. You can write rules on it, intelligent or perfectly stupid. For example, we could imagine that if I give you 1€, there are 0,10€ which are automatically paid back to some association. Or if I give you 1€, you will automatically owe me 1,10€ in a month. As the blockchain is programmable, once again, there is no need to trust a bank, it is the internal logic of the blockchain that imposes its rules. And that's where it gets interesting. We can therefore imagine rules that allow us to make loans, borrowings, and a whole bunch of other contracts that ultimately copy traditional finance, but in a programmatic way.

So it's impossible not to believe that all this is not the future. If I have 10,000€ in my bank account and I want to transfer 5,000€ to another account of a friend or family member, I have to go to the website of my bank. Then I have to add a beneficiary, hoping that all this will be done instantly and without validation. Then I have to make that transfer and hope that it works immediately that it arrives immediately and then that the Bank doesn't come and bother me or block me for some reason. If I were on the blockchain, one click and the transfer is done.

To this, you will probably retort, but there are laws when I make a transfer, there are rules that can sometimes prohibit me from doing so. Well, it's exactly the same thing on the blockchain, there are rules, but they are fixed, known to everyone and programmed. There is no one person who decides whether or not this transfer can be made. If there are fees, they are programmed and therefore they are the same for everyone.

## NFTs

So NFT's are a bit of a special topic. I also hate the word NFT. It has an ugly connotation. But in reality, an NFT is a bit like a file that is stored on the blockchain. I'm oversimplifying, but think of it like this. It's a document that sits in your wallet, the same way your currency itself does. Now, admittedly, most projects make it into image collections. But that doesn't make it any less of a beautiful product. Today to prove that you own your house, you have documents that are in your home and in a notary. Well, the NFT would allow the same thing but without a notary and without the need to store your document in your house. With NFT, it could be stored on a wallet programmatically. And we go back to the notion of intermediary, adding a layer of reliability. Even if it is more and more complicated, falsifying a document remains relatively easy, whereas today falsifying 1 NFT is impossible.

## Interconnections

There is a small notion that I would like to add and that concerns all cryptomoney and all blockchain as a whole. It is the notion of interconnection. We often read that traceability and transparency are the advantages of blockchain, but for me, it is the interconnection. Indeed, the main power of blockchain is the fact that it can be interconnected. In traditional finance, it is quite complicated to access your banking information. And it is even more complicated to prove your possessions. This is evidenced by the famous proof of address that you often have to send as soon as you want to do some administrative tasks. In a 100% blockchain world, all this would be much simpler. The data on the blockchain is all free and interconnected. If you need a proof of address, all you have to do is request it from the blockchain and it will respond instantly. And unlike the real world. It will be extremely reliable and unfalsifiable. So you will be 100% sure that this possession is real.

In the same way, if you need to take out a loan, it will be impossible to lie about your creditworthiness. You will be able to prove that you have the means to repay the loan. And the rules of over-indebtedness cannot be overridden. Moreover, in this world, the "transfer" following the loan request would be instantaneous, or, if a delay of 7 days is necessary, it would be automatic after **exactly** 7 days and not a minute more.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I would say that it is impossible to summarize my feelings without writing an article the size of a dictionary. However, I am convinced that all these technologies are the future, and contrary to many detractors, are not something that is useless or that do not add anything to what is already done. I think that blockchain is an absolutely fantastic tool that will allow the world we live in to evolve positively.
