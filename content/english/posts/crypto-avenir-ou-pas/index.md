TL;DR: YES.

## Introduction

I first became interested in cryptocurrencies in the 2010s. At that time, Bitcoin was probably the only one, or at least the only one I knew of. I found it fascinating, but I couldn't quite grasp what it was exactly. A kind of digital money? How does it work? Where is this money actually located? And is it really money? Can I convert Bitcoin into euros? And if so, how?

Ten years have passed. For a decade, I observed this world from afar without diving in too deep. Like many others, I initially thought it didn't really exist, consumed electricity, and served no other purpose. However, a few months ago, I started looking into it more closely. I sought concrete answers to my questions and read numerous articles on Bitcoin, other cryptocurrencies, blockchains, wallets, exchanges, ICOs, masternodes, forks, and more. I spent over an hour a day at the beginning.

I bought cryptocurrencies first on centralized platforms, similar to traditional banks. Later, I used protocols directly to exchange euros for cryptocurrencies. I bought and sold NFTs, used decentralized exchanges, took out loans, and even dabbled in futures contracts that I didn't know existed in traditional finance. I performed what are called bridges, transferring assets from one blockchain to another. I also attempted some development directly on the blockchain to better understand smart contracts.

As of writing, my main wallet contains 2,673 transactions made in less than a year. In comparison, my bank account has between 200 and 300 transactions during the same period. In just one year on blockchains, I've conducted more transactions than I have in a decade within traditional finance.

So, today, I believe I can confidently say whether cryptocurrencies serve a purpose or not. If they're complete nonsense, if they do nothing but consume electricity, and if traditional finance has nothing to fear.

## Cryptocurrency

I don't like talking about cryptocurrency. To me, it's just money. Some people might be alarmed to read this, likely because for a currency to be considered money, it must be recognized by a country or central bank. However, as an everyday consumer, I see no difference. In fact, I find everything much simpler on the blockchain. On the blockchain, I don't have a bank. The concept of a bank simply doesn't exist. There are only exchanges from wallet to wallet. Moreover, transactions occur almost instantly. While there are currently few links between cryptocurrency and the real world (I can't buy a loaf of bread with cryptocurrency, for example), everything I can buy on the blockchain in today's purely technological world can be done using my wallet, not a bank.

If you're not familiar with the concept, imagine a world without banks. Imagine that in your wallet, you have all your money—every cent. When you open your wallet, you see the entirety of your funds, as well as any loans or debts you owe to others. In essence, instead of having a bank, a place where you go to access your money, it's all in a physical object. And that greatly simplifies things. This is what sets the blockchain apart and makes everything much easier. In a completely blockchain-based world, there's no need for Paypal, Lydia, or meal vouchers. There likely wouldn't even be credit cards. There would only be people exchanging goods without intermediaries.

## DeFi

But it doesn't stop there. If there were only exchanges between individuals, the world of finance would not be able to adapt to it. The blockchain can be programmed. You can write rules on it, intelligent or perfectly stupid. For example, we could imagine that if I give you 1€, there are 0,10€ which are automatically paid back to some association. Or if I give you 1€, you will automatically owe me 1,10€ in a month. As the blockchain is programmable, once again, there is no need to trust a bank, it is the internal logic of the blockchain that imposes its rules. And that's where it gets interesting. We can therefore imagine rules that allow us to make loans, borrowings, and a whole bunch of other contracts that ultimately copy traditional finance, but in a programmatic way.

So it's impossible not to believe that all this is not the future. If I have 10,000€ in my bank account and I want to transfer 5,000€ to another account of a friend or family member, I have to go to the website of my bank. Then I have to add a beneficiary, hoping that all this will be done instantly and without validation. Then I have to make that transfer and hope that it works immediately that it arrives immediately and then that the Bank doesn't come and bother me or block me for some reason. If I were on the blockchain, one click and the transfer is done.

To this, you will probably retort, but there are laws when I make a transfer, there are rules that can sometimes prohibit me from doing so. Well, it's exactly the same thing on the blockchain, there are rules, but they are fixed, known to everyone and programmed. There is no one person who decides whether or not this transfer can be made. If there are fees, they are programmed and therefore they are the same for everyone.

## NFTs

So NFT's are a bit of a special topic. I also hate the word NFT. It has an ugly connotation. But in reality, an NFT is a bit like a file that is stored on the blockchain. I'm oversimplifying, but think of it like this. It's a document that sits in your wallet, the same way your currency itself does. Now, admittedly, most projects make it into image collections. But that doesn't make it any less of a beautiful product. Today to prove that you own your house, you have documents that are in your home and in a notary. Well, the NFT would allow the same thing but without a notary and without the need to store your document in your house. With NFT, it could be stored on a wallet programmatically. And we go back to the notion of intermediary, adding a layer of reliability. Even if it is more and more complicated, falsifying a document remains relatively easy, whereas today falsifying 1 NFT is impossible.

## Interconnections

There is a small notion that I would like to add and that concerns all cryptomoney and all blockchain as a whole. It is the notion of interconnection. We often read that traceability and transparency are the advantages of blockchain, but for me, it is the interconnection. Indeed, the main power of blockchain is the fact that it can be interconnected. In traditional finance, it is quite complicated to access your banking information. And it is even more complicated to prove your possessions. This is evidenced by the famous proof of address that you often have to send as soon as you want to do some administrative tasks. In a 100% blockchain world, all this would be much simpler. The data on the blockchain is all free and interconnected. If you need a proof of address, all you have to do is request it from the blockchain and it will respond instantly. And unlike the real world. It will be extremely reliable and unfalsifiable. So you will be 100% sure that this possession is real.

In the same way, if you need to take out a loan, it will be impossible to lie about your creditworthiness. You will be able to prove that you have the means to repay the loan. And the rules of over-indebtedness cannot be overridden. Moreover, in this world, the "transfer" following the loan request would be instantaneous, or, if a delay of 7 days is necessary, it would be automatic after **exactly** 7 days and not a minute more.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, I would say that it is impossible to summarize my feelings without writing an article the size of a dictionary. However, I am convinced that all these technologies are the future, and contrary to many detractors, are not something that is useless or that do not add anything to what is already done. I think that blockchain is an absolutely fantastic tool that will allow the world we live in to evolve positively.
